# RentMyBook_Mobile_Application


## About
Group project from Mobile Application Development course at California State University, Long Beach. The app helps a student to organizes their rental to another student via the app. The authentication system is linked directly to students account via Microsoft API. We use Firebase to keep track on extra user data beside name, email, and phone number from their student account, such as profile picture, reward points, and books that the user own.

## Problems:
+ The price of textbooks
increases every year
+ Renting or buying used
books are still expensive
+ The only economic option
is to illegally download or
torrent books

## Solutions:
+ Create a mobile app that allows students
to rent books from their colleagues
+ Often times, students end up buying
textbooks, only to find out that their
friends took the course previously and
already own the book

## Our Vision:
+ We want to change the world, one
student at a time!
+ Students will benefit by saving
hundreds of dollars on textbooks
every semester
+ We hope that our idea will give rise to
more innovative ways for students to
save money
